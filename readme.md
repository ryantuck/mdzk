# mdzk

Markdown zettelkasten built with `mkdocs`.

## run

```
make serve
```

## config file

Define a `mdzk.yml` file:

```yml
# required
docs_dir: ~/path/to/markdown_notes

include:
  - code
  - cool-stuff

exclude:
  - _index
  - archive
  - super-private-note
```

## notes

Still plenty of work to do to make this sweet.
